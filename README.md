## Prompt Engineering Approach

ReserveMate uses a carefully crafted system prompt that balances conversational abilities with function-calling capabilities:

### Core Principles

1. **Conversational First**: The AI maintains a friendly, personable conversation flow that feels natural to users.

2. **Tool Integration**: The system is designed to leverage tools for restaurant searches and reservation management rather than hallucinating responses.

3. **Progressive Information Gathering**: Rather than overwhelming users with multiple questions at once, the AI gathers information conversationally and progressively.

4. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The AI understands restaurant terminology and reservation processes.

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

- **Persona Definition**: Clear definition of the AI's role as ReserveMate
- **Instruction Clarity**: Explicit instructions on when to use tools and how to interact
- **Error Prevention**: Specific guidelines to prevent common LLM issues like hallucination
- **Conversational Guardrails**: Rules that ensure the conversation stays helpful and on-topic

### Tool Integration

Tools are defined with clear schemas and integrated with session state to enable:
- Restaurant searches with flexible parameters
- Reservation creation with validation
- Reservation modification and cancellation
